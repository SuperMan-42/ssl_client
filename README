/*
These processes are performed
   in the ssl3 protocol, which can be summarized as follows: the
   client sends a client hello message to which the server must respond
   with a server hello message, or else a fatal error will occur and the
   connection will fail.  The client hello and server hello are used to
   establish security enhancement capabilities between client and
   server.  The client hello and server hello establish the following
   attributes: Protocol Version, Session ID, Cipher Suite, and
   Compression Method.  Additionally, two clientRandom values are generated
   and exchanged: ClientHello.clientRandom and ServerHello.clientRandom.
